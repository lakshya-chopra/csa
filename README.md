## Topics:

### Digital Electronics:
  - Boolean Algebra
  - K maps
  - Combinational Circuits
  - Sequential circuits
  - Flip flops & latches
  - State diagrams, state tables, excitation tables, characteristic tables
  - Designing a sequential circuit.
  
**for questions asking to design a sequential circuit using the given state table**:
  
  - **Read Morris Mano's Computer System Arch. Chap 1 Page 33-37.**

  - Draw a table with columns: Present states, inputs given, next state, Flip flop inputs
  - Note that the number of FFâ€™s = the number of states (considering each FF gives one output).
  - This means, first an excitation table for the present state and then for the next states (where inputs are the ff inputs)
  - Find the boolean expression for FF inputs using K-maps.
  - [Practice Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t875Z-VCasQ)
    
  - ### **If checkboard like Pattern in the K-map** : the expression is just the xor of all the arguments involved.

**Latches v/s Flip Flops**:
  - Flip flops are made of two latches connected with each other with one being the master and another, the slave, each having opposite polarity clocks, which makes them edge triggered. While this is not the case with Latches, hence, they are level triggered.

**Understand the problem T FF solves which JK flip flop doesn't**

**Why does D FF lead to delay?**  

**Why should the clock frequency be higher than the frequency of propagation in the gates to avoid race condition?**

**Learn to realize circuits using universal gates only (eg: implementing Half adder using only NAND GATE)**

### Questions are asked where you have to compute a K-Map and then implement the expression using only certain gates (like 2 NORs, NAND and OR, NAND & AND)

### Learn the logic behind the truth table of 4 to 2 encoder and a 2 to 4 decoder.

### 5 to 32 decoder, using 3-8 decoders only. [helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcnmb7XuA8Y)

### ADRESSING MODES:
  - Immediate addressing : the value of the operand is specified directly in the instruction (no need to access memory).
  - Implied addressing : When the operand value isn't clearly stated but it is implied, for eg: ADD R1,R2 => Here, it is implied that the contents of R2 need to be added to R1.
  - Direct addressing : stating the memory address of the operand. [This address goes to the AR, which has **address access** to the memory, and then the operand at that address is placed on the common bus, where is loaded into the specified register]
  - Indirect addressing
  - Base Register Relative : Here, the effective address = addr of Base register + the offset (offset can be implemented through the *branch* instruction)

  - PC Relative
  - Indexed Addressing : Effective ADDR = Base addr + value of Index Register.

### If transferring 12 bit data to 16 bit, then add 4 0's in the start of 12 bit data (i.e. move the actual data to LSB)
### If transferring from 16 bit to 12, then
